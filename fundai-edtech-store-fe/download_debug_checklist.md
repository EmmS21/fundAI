# Download Debugging Checklist

## Issue: Download fails with 500 Internal Server Error

**Log Evidence:**
```
[1] [DownloadManager] Response status: 500
[1] 17:13:48.583 â€º [Download] downloadManager error: Error: Download failed: 500 Internal Server Error
```

## Potential Causes & Checks:

### Backend (`fundaihubstore.onrender.com`)
*   [ ] **Check Server Logs on Render.com:** The `500 Internal Server Error` means the server itself had a problem. The most direct way to diagnose this is to check the logs for your `fundaihubstore` application on Render.com for the timeframe around `17:13:48` (according to your log timestamp). Look for any error messages, stack traces, or details about why the request to `/download/40456bb0-2b0a-4da8-af2b-9...` failed.
*   [ ] **File Availability/Permissions:**
    *   Does the file corresponding to `content_id=40456bb0-2b0a-4da8-af2b-9e9a419ee459` actually exist where the backend expects to find it?
    *   Does the backend service have the correct permissions to read and serve this file?
*   [ ] **Backend Download Logic:**
    *   Is there an issue in the backend code that handles the `/download/:content_id` route? (e.g., database lookup for the file path, file streaming issues, incorrect header settings).
*   [ ] **Resource Limits on Render.com:** Is it possible the service is hitting resource limits (memory, CPU, disk space) that cause it to fail when trying to serve a large file?
*   [ ] **Dependencies:** Are all backend dependencies (e.g., connection to a storage service like S3/Cloud Storage if files are not stored directly on Render) functioning correctly?

### Frontend (Electron App)
*   [ ] **Incorrect URL generation (Less Likely):** While the `/api/downloads/url` endpoint seems to work, double-check if any part of the URL passed to the `downloadManager` could be malformed, though the logs show a seemingly correct URL.
*   [ ] **Headers/Request Method (Less Likely):** Is the `downloadManager` making a simple GET request as expected? Any unusual headers that the backend might reject for the `/download` endpoint (but not for `/api/downloads/url`)?

## Next Steps:
1.  **Prioritize checking the backend server logs on Render.com.** This is most likely to give a specific error message.
2.  If backend logs are uninformative, try to manually access the generated download URL (e.g., `https://fundaihubstore.onrender.com/download/40456bb0-2b0a-4da8-af2b-9...`) in a browser or with a tool like `curl` to see if the error is reproducible and if any more detailed error message is returned directly.
