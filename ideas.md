Here's more context about FundaAI and how you can contribute:

**FundaAI:** https://www.fundawithai.com/

An AI School turning self-driven 12-18 year old Africans into globally competitive software engineers through two approaches:

1. **Virtual campus** - Kids buy laptops with an offline AI brain and an ecosystem of AI tutors to build problem-solving and engineering skills
2. **Virtual apprenticeship** - Kids work with experienced engineers to build and debug AI tutors in a simulated engineering team

**Current Progress:**
I built the MVP: a Linux laptop with a fine-tuned local model, syncing with larger open source models, an app store to distribute AI tutors, and a few AI tutors (exam prep, project guidance). I shipped this to my 12-year-old nephew in Zimbabwe who I mentor weekly.

**How open source fits in:**
"Iron sharpens iron" - open source helped me become an engineer. You decide which AI Tutor to build. I'll pair program with you, then break it into smaller tickets. The kids will work on some of the tickets, we will review thier code to give them feedback. A mentor will guide code reviews, creating a virtual apprenticeship where kids learn while building.

**Why this matters:**
I self-taught myself into software engineering - it was hard but builds character. I want to give African kids the same opportunity with better guidance. There's huge potential in building Africa into an engineering hub.
