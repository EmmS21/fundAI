# Weekly Check-In Guide for Students

## Why We Do Weekly Check-Ins

**The honest truth:** In the real world, your visibility often matters more than the raw work you do.

You can be the most talented person on a team, but if no one knows what you're working on, what you're struggling with, or what you're thinking—you become invisible. Invisible people don't get opportunities, mentorship, or support.

Engineers don't work in isolation. Every professional environment—whether at Google, a startup, or a small team—requires you to communicate clearly about:
- What you're doing
- What's blocking you
- What help you need

**This is not busywork.** This is a core engineering skill that separates good developers from great ones.

## The Weekly Check-In Template

Copy and fill out this template every week:

```
### Weekly Check-In: [Your Name] | Week of [Date]

**1. What I worked on this week:**
- [Task/feature/bug you tackled]
- [Include specific details: files, functions, concepts]

**2. What I learned:**
- [New concept, tool, or technique you discovered]
- [Something that surprised you or changed how you think]

**3. What I'm stuck on / Questions I have:**
- [Be specific! "I don't understand X" is better than "I'm confused"]
- [Include what you already tried]

**4. What I plan to work on next week:**
- [Your focus for the coming week]

**5. How I'm feeling about my progress:**
- [Honest reflection: confident, overwhelmed, curious, frustrated?]
```

## How to Ask Good Questions

**You don't become an engineer by completing tasks. You become an engineer by understanding WHY things work.**

### Bad Questions ❌
- "It doesn't work"
- "I'm stuck"
- "I don't get it"
- "Can you just fix it?"

### Good Questions ✅
- "I expected X to happen, but Y happened instead. I've tried A and B. What am I missing?"
- "I understand that this function does X, but I don't understand why we use it here instead of Y"
- "I read the documentation but I'm confused about how [specific concept] applies to our codebase"
- "Before I start, I want to make sure I understand the goal: Are we trying to accomplish X or Y?"

### The Formula for a Good Question

1. **State what you're trying to do**
2. **Show what you tried**
3. **Explain what happened vs. what you expected**
4. **Ask your specific question**

Example:
> "I'm trying to add a new button to the dashboard (goal). I copied the existing button component and changed the text (what I tried). But when I click it, nothing happens—no errors in console either (what happened). I expected the onClick handler to fire. Am I missing a step to wire up the event handler? (specific question)"

## Our Expectations & Boundaries

### What We Expect
- **Weekly check-ins submitted on time** (every Friday by end of day)
- **At least 1-2 genuine questions per week** (not "everything is fine")
- **Honest updates**—we'd rather know you're struggling than have you disappear
- **Engagement during pair programming sessions**

### The Three-Warning Policy

We operate on a **three-warning system**:

| Warning | Triggered By |
|---------|--------------|
| **1st Warning** | Missing a check-in without communication, or check-in with zero questions/engagement |
| **2nd Warning** | Repeated pattern of no questions, surface-level updates, or lack of engagement |
| **3rd Warning** | Final notice before removal from the program |

**If you receive 3 warnings, you will be removed from the program.**

This isn't about being harsh—it's about being fair to:
- Engineers who volunteer their time to mentor you
- Other students who are actively engaged
- Your own growth (if you're not engaging, you're not learning)

### How to Avoid Warnings
- Submit your check-ins on time
- Ask real questions (even if they feel "dumb")
- If you're overwhelmed or need a break, **tell us**—communication prevents warnings
- Show up mentally, not just physically

## The Intention Behind This

When you send a check-in, your engineer mentor and team can:

1. **Understand your thought process** — Not just what you did, but how you approached it
2. **Identify where you need support** — We can't help if we don't know you're stuck
3. **Celebrate your wins** — Small progress is still progress
4. **Adjust the difficulty** — If things are too easy or too hard, we need to know
5. **Build trust** — Consistent communication builds professional relationships

### For Your Future

Every job you'll ever have will require some form of status updates:
- **Standup meetings** — Daily check-ins with your team
- **Sprint reviews** — Weekly/bi-weekly progress reports
- **1:1s with managers** — Career and project discussions
- **Documentation** — Written records of what you built and why

The students who master this skill now will have a massive advantage when they enter the workforce. You'll already know how to:
- Communicate technical work to non-technical people
- Ask for help without feeling embarrassed
- Make your contributions visible
- Build relationships with mentors and colleagues

## Quick Reference

| Do This ✅ | Not This ❌ |
|-----------|-------------|
| "I'm stuck on X, I tried Y and Z" | "I'm stuck" |
| "I don't understand why we use A instead of B" | "I don't get it" |
| "I worked on the login feature, specifically the password validation" | "I worked on stuff" |
| "I'm feeling overwhelmed this week" | *Radio silence* |
| Submit check-in even if incomplete | Skip check-in entirely |

## Remember

**Asking questions is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of someone who wants to actually understand.**

The best engineers we know ask the most questions. They're curious. They want to know *why*, not just *what*.

That's who we're trying to help you become.
