Core Learning Paths:
| How Computers Work         | Systems thinking, abstraction, mental models                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware Components        | Understanding CPU, RAM, storage, I/O                                   |
| Software & OS Interactions | Scheduling, memory management, user programs, process, threads, memory |
| Everyday Examples          | What happens when I open a game/browser/app?                           |
| Debugging                  | How things work, debugging mental models                               |

Design Principles:
- Structured First, Curious Later: Linear progression with branching “challenge paths”
- Metaphors Matter: CPU as a chef, RAM as the counter, OS as the head waiter
- Offline-First Friendly: Lightweight, can run without internet after installation
- No Chat Required: Kids don’t need to know what to ask, app scaffolds the experience

| Feature                   | Skills Developed                                          |

| Flashcards (Spaced Rep.)  | Long-term memory retention, focus on weak areas           |
| Exam Simulations          | Time management, critical thinking, applied understanding |
| Recommendation Engine     | Meta-cognition, self-paced learning                       |
| Personalized Progress Map | Accountability, planning, consistency                     |
| Reflective Prompts        | Learning from mistakes, reflection-driven improvement     |

 
Design Principles:

- Structure with Flexibility: Daily schedules and review plans generated, but modifiable
- Feedback-Driven: Wrong answers trigger mini-lessons or links to deeper tutors (like System Sensei)
- Memory-Aware: Tutor remembers student weaknesses and suggests recovery plans
- Offline First: Sync when online, but stores all progress locally with periodic backups
- No Chat Needed: Navigation is intuitive, structured, and voice-like hints are pre-scripted
