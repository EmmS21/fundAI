# Dagger Testing Plan

## Test Categories
### 1. Unit Tests
#### Google Drive Tests
- Test authentication with valid/invalid credentials
- Test listing education levels
- Test folder structure mapping
- Test paper name parsing with various formats
- Test handling of unexpected folder structures
#### MongoDB Tests
- Test connection with valid/invalid connection strings
- Test document creation with various inputs
- Test error handling for connection issues
- Test document validation
#### Orchestration Tests
- Test processing of individual education levels
- Test document creation from folder structure
- Test error handling during processing
- Test progress tracking
### 2. Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end flow from Drive to MongoDB
- Test handling of real folder structures
- Test recovery from failures
- Test performance with large datasets
### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Mock Google Drive API responses for predictable testing
- Use MongoDB memory server for database tests
- Create fixture data for various education levels
### 4. Test Implementation
- Each test file should:
  - Set up necessary mocks and fixtures
  - Execute the function under test
  - Verify the expected outcomes
  - Clean up any resources
### Example Test Cases
#### Paper Parser Tests
- Parse standard paper name: "Paper-1.pdf"
- Parse paper with term: "Paper-2Oct.pdf"
- Parse paper with version: "Paper-3:42.pdf"
- Parse paper with term and version: "Paper-4:31Oct.pdf"
- Handle invalid paper name: "NotAPaper.pdf"
#### MongoDB Document Tests
- Create document with all required fields
- Validate document against schema
- Test index creation
- Test document updates
#### Orchestration Tests
- Process level with valid structure
- Handle missing folders
- Track progress correctly
- Report errors appropriately?
