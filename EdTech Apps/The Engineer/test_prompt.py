2. **Problem Statement**: Many African communities lack access to clean water, leading to poor health outcomes. This project aims to help users request water from a simulated well, display current levels, and provide recommendations based on proximity.

3. **Project Description**: The app will allow users to request water from a simulated well, display the current level, and offer recommendations for better access. It includes a map service to visualize water sources.

4. **Key Features**: 
   - Requesting water from a well
   - Displaying current water level (via visual indicator)  
   - Showing the closest source of water
   - Providing recommendations based on proximity
   - Adding a map to show where the water is available

5. **Recommended Technology Stack**: 
   - Frontend: JavaScript for simplicity and ease of use
   - Backend: No backend needed, using vanilla JavaScript
   - Database: SQLite for simplicity
   - Additional Tools: Map service (e.g., Google Maps API)

6. **Difficulty Assessment**: This project is challenging but suitable for a 12-18 year old as it introduces practical problem-solving and data visualization while teaching user recommendations.'''
