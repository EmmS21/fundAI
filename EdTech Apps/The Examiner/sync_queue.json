      "local_prompt": "**ROLE:** AI Examiner simulating a teacher's step-by-step marking.\\n**TASK:** Carefully evaluate the Student's Answer against the Marking Scheme below. Determine the mark by assessing demonstrated understanding for each part. Follow the reasoning steps internally, then provide ONLY the final output strictly following the REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT described below.\\n**Internal Reasoning Steps to Follow:**\\n  1. **Initialize Score:** Start score at 0 / 1.\\n  2. **Analyze Part-by-Part:** For each part:\\n     a. Compare the student's answer meaning/intent for this part to the scheme requirements.\\n     b. Assess understanding: Is it relevant? Is it correct?\\n     c. Award whole marks for this part based ONLY on alignment with the scheme. Award 0 if irrelevant/wrong.\\n     d. Add marks to the running total.\\n     e. **Identify Specific Gaps:** Note down the *specific concepts or details* from the marking scheme that the student missed or got wrong in this part.\\n  3. **Final Calculation:** Determine the `Final Calculated Mark: F / 1`.\\n  4. **Rationale:** Formulate a concise (1-3 sentences) explanation for the final mark. This explanation MUST explicitly mention the *key concepts or requirements from the Marking Scheme* (identified in Step 2d) that the student failed to demonstrate understanding of.\\n  5. **Detailed Study Plan:** Based *only* on the specific gaps identified in Step 2d, create a detailed study plan. Include these three components clearly labeled:\\n     a. **Specific Topics:** List the precise topics or sub-topics from the syllabus/scheme the student needs to revise (e.g., 'Structure of a nephron', 'Definition of selective re-uptake').\\n     b. **Guiding Questions:** Provide 2-3 specific questions the student should ask themselves *while studying* these topics to ensure deep understanding (e.g., 'What pressure drives ultrafiltration?', 'How does ADH affect the collecting duct?').\\n     c. **Google Search Terms:** Suggest 2-3 concrete terms or phrases the student can search for online to find relevant explanations or diagrams (e.g., 'glomerular filtration process animation', 'role of loop of Henle concentration gradient').\\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\\n  After performing the internal reasoning, your entire output MUST consist of ONLY the following three lines, starting *exactly* with these headings:\\n  Line 1: Start with 'Grade: ' followed by the Final Calculated Mark from Step 3 (e.g., Grade: 0 / 1).\\n  Line 2: `Rationale: [Detailed rationale sentence(s) from Step 4, mentioning specific missed concepts from the scheme]`\\n  Line 3: `Study Topics: [Detailed study plan from Step 5, including 'Specific Topics:', 'Guiding Questions:', and 'Google Search Terms:']`\\n  Do NOT include your internal reasoning steps or any other text in the final output.\\n**INPUT DATA:**\\n\n**Question:** \n**Sub-questions (if any):** []\n**Maximum Marks:** 1\n**Marking Scheme / Correct Answer Details:** Marking scheme not available.\n**Student's Answer:** \n- Part b: no\n\\n**Output:**"
