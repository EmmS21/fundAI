  - [x] Create `CredentialManager` class
  - [x] Add support for system keychain (macOS/Linux)
  - [x] Implement hardware-derived key fallback
  - [x] Create first-run setup flow for MongoDB URI input

## 2. Cache System Enhancements

- [x] Update `CacheManager` for MongoDB integration
  - [x] Modify `_run` method to check for new content when online
  - [x] Adjust `save_question` to handle MongoDB document structure
  - [x] Update cache invalidation logic for question-based model
  - [x] Add handling for question assets (images, diagrams)

- [x] Implement intelligent prefetching
  - [x] Create prioritization based on user subjects
  - [x] Add background fetching during idle periods
  - [x] Implement storage space management

## 3. Sync System Integration

- [ ] Update `SyncService` for MongoDB
