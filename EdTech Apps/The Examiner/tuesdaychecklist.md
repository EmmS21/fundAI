  - [ ] Add logging for connection events

- [ ] Implement secure credential storage
  - [ ] Create `CredentialManager` class
  - [ ] Add support for system keychain (macOS/Linux)
  - [ ] Implement hardware-derived key fallback
  - [ ] Create first-run setup flow for MongoDB URI input

## 2. Cache System Enhancements

- [ ] Update `CacheManager` for MongoDB integration
  - [ ] Modify `_run` method to check for new content when online
  - [ ] Adjust `save_question` to handle MongoDB document structure
  - [ ] Update cache invalidation logic for question-based model
  - [ ] Add handling for question assets (images, diagrams)

- [ ] Implement intelligent prefetching
  - [ ] Create prioritization based on user subjects
  - [ ] Add background fetching during idle periods
  - [ ] Implement storage space management

## 3. Sync System Integration

- [ ] Update `SyncService` for MongoDB
  - [ ] Replace Firebase methods with MongoDB client calls

  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for MongoDB errors

## 4. Network Detection Improvements

- [ ] Enhance `NetworkMonitor` for more robust detection
  - [ ] Add validation check with lightweight request
  - [ ] Implement "settling time" to prevent rapid toggling

  - [ ] Add troubleshooting tools for connection issues

## 6. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create test suite for MongoDB connectivity
  - [ ] Test connection with various network conditions
  - [ ] Validate credential storage across restarts
  - [ ] Test cache persistence and invalidation

- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing
  - [ ] Test offline fallback behavior
  - [ ] Validate sync queue persistence
  - [ ] Measure performance with large question sets

## 7. Documentation

  - [ ] Plan for future schema evolution

- [ ] Address platform-specific behavior
  - [ ] Test credential storage on various Linux distributions
  - [ ] Verify network detection on all target platforms
  - [ ] Ensure MongoDB driver compatibility
